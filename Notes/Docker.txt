Docker is software that allows us to put our entire project into what is referred to as a 
"container". These containers ensure that software can be run across many machines as all of these
machines will end up running the same container which are all setup the same way ensuring the
software will run accordingly across these different machines.

To start the docker container, naviagte to the "Docker" directory in the projects root directory
and type the following command...

	docker-compose up

From here the docker container will be running and you can access it via the IP address given
to you when you run the previous command.
