Docker is software that allows us to put our entire project into what is referred to as a 
"container". These containers ensure that software can be run across many machines as all of these
machines will end up running the same container which are all setup the same way ensuring the
software will run accordingly across these different machines.

To start the docker container, naviagte to the "Docker" directory in the projects root directory
and type the following command...

	docker-compose up

From here the docker container will be running and you can access it via the IP address given
to you when you run the previous command.

When you want to shutdown the docker container you can just press ctrl+c, but if this does not
work then you can also run the following command...

	sudo systemctl restart docker.socket docker.service

To check if any docker conatiners are currently running rou can type the following command

	docker ps

I have also noticed repeatedly that as I shut down the docker container and attempt to restart
it, I receive an error message that states the certain ports are already in use. I am not sure
if I am shutting down the containers incorrectly or why this error is occuring. But in order to get
around this error message we can just kill the processes that are utilizing these ports. For starters
see which port docker is complaining about, then run the following command to see what process is
utilizing this port...

	sudo lsof -i :PORTNUMBER

This will provide some output on which processes are using this port, then you will need to get the
process idea from this output and run the following command to kill it...

	sudo kill PID

Another useful command when you run some of the ones
from above is to run the following...

	docker container prune

This will help clean up the forced shutdown of the docker
container by releasing any ports that were being used
by it.
